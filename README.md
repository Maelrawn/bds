This is my final project for CSC211. The description is as follows:

Final Project
A 2-Class based menu-driven program that is used to track and manage the customer account info and purchases for your choice of business.
On launch the program should introduce itself and your business and load all the existing customer account info from a file of any size and store them in a vector of a class called AllCustomers.
It should then Load all purchase information from a file of any size and store them in a vector of a class called AllPurchases.
AllCustomers Data Model (should include but is not limited to):
First Name
Last Name
Account #
Street Address
City
State
Zip Code
Phone Number
AllPurchases Data Model (should include but is not limited to):
Account Number
Item
Date
Amount
Requirements – 85% of Grade
Menu driven program that loops after each selection until user chooses to exit
Load all Customer account Info from a file into a vector of the class
Use a vector within the class to store purchase information
All functions should be a public member function of your classes.
Menu Options:
Print out all list of all customers
Option to sort and print Customer list in descending or ascending order
Print out a specific customer’s account information
Print out the total spend for all a customers purchases
Add a new customer
Add multiple customers (Use Recursive Function)
Update a customer’s information
Delete a customer’s information
Add a new customer’s purchase
Add multiple new customer purchases (Use Recursive Function)
Let the user save over the existing import files or copy to a new file
All work and procedures to be completed in Member Functions
Code should be split across 5 Files (Main.CPP, Class1.H, Class1.CPP, Class2.H, Class2.CPP)
Comment all code and functions
Use advanced course material where necessary (Constructors, Overloaded Assignment Operators, Destructors, Pointers, Recursion, Sorting and Searching)
 
User Interface & Experience – 15% of Grade
Design with the users in mind, easy to use, hard to break (I will try)
Output should be easy to read and understand using things like set precision, set width, aligning output in table format, numbering to select instead of typing names.
Feel free to add additional menu items or features.
